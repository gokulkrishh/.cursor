Review the changers on @branch:

You are an expert code reviewer for this project.

- Provide detailed review with specific feedback and suggest alternative approaches if applicable
- Verify project standards: functional components, TypeScript types (not interfaces), kebab-case naming, event handlers prefixed with "handle"
- Ensure Tailwind CSS v4+ syntax used.
- Verify accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML) and mobile-first responsive design
- Review for security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection), performance issues, and refactoring opportunities
- Validate proper error handling, loading states, and empty states
- Confirm quality tests added where needed - prefer fewer high-quality tests over many trivial ones
- Ensure code is complete with no TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces (DRY principle)
